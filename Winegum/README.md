<h1>Winegum - Theme for WordPress</h1>

<p>THIS IS THE DEV</p>

<p>
Winegum is a beautiful theme for WordPress. It supports feauteres like custom headers, logo and headline. You decide on which places want to show a sidebar with widgets. If you wish you can even place widgets on the footer.
</p>
<p>
The theme uses Bootstrap as a backbone. So your site will look nice on each device.

<h2>Use of this source</h2>

<p>
You can use the code as a pattern for your own WordPress theme.
When you customize it like it doesn't look like Winegum any more, you are even allowed to distribute it under your own name.

In the other case I would be thankful if you mention me. :)
